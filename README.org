#+TITLE: Browser Performance Test

* Running

To run this sample, open a terminal window and type:

#+begin_src shell

boot dev

#+end_src

and visit [[http://localhost:3000][http://localhost:3000]] in your browser.

* Experiment Design

This sample app allows you to specify a JSON endpoint to request via XHR. The UI
allows you to control the concurrency level and the delay between requests. Once
you've set these values, click the *Start* button to run the test. Keep an eye on
the network tab in your browser's development tools during the test. We're
trying to recreate conditions under which the requests will run serially instead
of in parallel. Click *Stop* to pause the execution and dump the contents of the
state atom to the console. Resume by clicking *Start*, or click *Reset* to clear the
console and restore the application to its initial state.
